      <description>Title: Learning with limited labels for visual recognition
Speaker: Hamed Pirsiavash, University of California, Davis
Date and Time: Monday, June 12, 11am - 12pm
Place: Room 304, Teknikringen 14
Abstract:
We are interested in learning visual representations that are discriminative for semantic image understanding tasks such as object classification, detection, and segmentation in images/videos. A common approach to obtain such features is to use supervised learning. However, this requires manual annotation of images, which is costly, ambiguous, and prone to errors.</description>
